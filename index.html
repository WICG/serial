The <cite>Serial API</cite> provides a way for websites to read and write from a
serial device through script. Such an API would bridge the web and the physical
world, by allowing documents to communicate with devices such as
microcontrollers, 3D printers, and other serial devices.

There is also a companion <a

document.

    <h3><dfn>requestPort()</dfn> method</h3>

    <aside class="example">
      When the user first visits a site it will not have permission to access
      any serial devices. A site must first call {{Serial/requestPort()}}. This
      call gives the browser the opportunity to prompt the user for which device
      the site should be allowed to control. If the site is designed to work
      with a particular device which is always connected via USB the site can
      provide a filter restricting the devices the user can select to only those
      that would be compatible. For example, a site which programs
      Arduino-powered robots could specify a like the following to limit the set
      of selectable ports to only USB devices with Arduino's USB vendor ID,

      <pre class="js">
        const filter = { usbVendorId: 0x2341 };
        const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort({ filters: [filter] });
      </pre>

      If on the other hand the site expects to be used with a wide variety of
      devices or devices connected through a USB to serial converter it may
      specify no filter at all and rely on the user to select the appropriate
      device,

      <pre class="js">
        const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort();
      </pre>

      Asking the user to choose a port requires showing a prompt to the user and
      so the site must have [=transient activation=] from something like the
      user clicking a button.

      <pre class="html">
        &lt;button id="connect">Connect&lt;/button>
      </pre>

      <pre class="js">
        const connectButton = document.getElementById("connect");
        connectButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
          try {
            const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort();
            // Continue connecting to the device attached to |port|.
          } catch (e) {
            // The prompt has been dismissed without selecting a device.
          }
        });
      </pre>

      The user may choose not to select a device, in which case the {{Promise}}
      will be rejected with a "{{NotFoundError}}" {{DOMException}} that the site
      must handle.

      An application receiving data from a serial port will typically use a
      nested pair of loops like this,

      <pre class="js">
        while (port.readable) {
          const reader = port.readable.getReader();
          try {
            while (true) {
              const { value, done } = await reader.read();
              if (done) {
                // |reader| has been canceled.
                break;
              }
              // Do something with |value|...
            }
          } catch (error) {
            // Handle |error|...
          } finally {
            reader.releaseLock();
          }
        }
      </pre>

      The inner loop will read chunks of data from the port until an error is
      encountered, at which point the code in the "catch" block will be
      executed. The outer loop handles recoverable errors such as parity check
      failures by opening a new reader. Fatal errors will cause
      {{SerialPort/readable}} to become `null` and the loop to end.

      <p>
      As long as the serial port is open it can continue to produce data and the
      amount of data in each of the chunks returned by
      {{ReadableStreamDefaultReader/read()}} will be essentially arbitrary based
      on the timing of when it is called. It is up to the device and the code
      communicating with it to decide what constitutes a complete message. For
      example, a device might communicate with the host using ASCII-formatted
      text where each message ends with a newline (or the sequence `"\r\n"`). A
      pipeline of {{TransformStream}}s can be used to automatically convert the
      {{Uint8Array}} chunks provided by {{SerialPort/readable}} into
      {{DOMString}}s containing an entire line of text each.

      <pre class="js">
        class LineBreakTransformer {
          constructor() {
            this.container = '';
          }

          transform(chunk, controller) {
            this.container += chunk;
            const lines = this.container.split('\r\n');
            this.container = lines.pop();
            lines.forEach(line => controller.enqueue(line));
          }

          flush(controller) {
            controller.enqueue(this.container);
          }
        }

        const lineReader = port.readable
            .pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream())
            .pipeThrough(new TransformStream(new LineBreakTransformer()))
            .getReader();
      </pre>

      Some other ways of encoding message boundaries are to prefix each message
      with its length or to wait a defined length of time before transmitting
      the next message. Implementing a {{TransformStream}} for these types of
      message boundaries is left as an exercise for the reader.

      <p>
      While the {{ReadableStreamDefaultReader/read()}} method is asynchronous
      and does not block execution, in code using async/await syntax it can
      seem as if it does. In this situation it may be helpful to implement a
      timeout which will allow the code to continue execution if no data is
      received for a period of time. The example below uses the
      {{ReadableStreamDefaultReader/releaseLock()}} method to interrupt a call
      to {{ReadableStreamDefaultReader/read()}} after a timer expires. This
      will not close the stream and so any data received after the timeout can
      still be read later after calling {{ReadableStream/getReader()}} again.

      <pre class="js">
        async function readWithTimeout(port, timeout) {
          const reader = port.readable.getReader();
          const timer = setTimeout(() => {
            reader.releaseLock();
          }, timeout);
          const result = await reader.read();
          clearTimeout(timer);
          reader.releaseLock();
          return result;
        }
      </pre>

      This feature of {{ReadableStreamDefaultReader/releaseLock()}} was added
      in <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/streams/pull/1168">whatwg/streams#1168</a>
      and has only recently been implemented by browsers.

    <aside class="example">
      To write individual chunks of data to the port a
      {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter}} can be created and released as necessary.
      This example uses a `TextEncoder` to encode a {{DOMString}} as the
      necessary {{Uint8Array}} for transmission.

      <pre class="js">
        const encoder = new TextEncoder();
        const writer = port.writable.getWriter();
        await writer.write(encoder.encode("PING"));
        writer.releaseLock();
      </pre>

      When writing larger chunks it can be important to allow the port to apply
      back pressure so that the serial transmitter does not get too far behind
      sending data generated by the application. The
      {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()}} method returns a {{Promise}} which
      resolves when data has been written. While having some data available in
      the transmit buffer is important to maintain good throughput awaiting this
      {{Promise}} before generating too many chunks of data is a good practice
      to avoid excessive buffering.

    <h3><dfn>close()</dfn> method</h3>

    <aside class="example">
      When communication with the port is no longer required it can be closed
      and the associated resources released by the system.

      <p>
      Calling `port.`{{SerialPort/close()}} implicitly invokes
      `port.`{{SerialPort/readable}}`.`{{ReadableStream/cancel()}} and
      `port.`{{SerialPort/writable}}`.`{{WritableStream/abort()}} in order to
      clear any buffered data. If the application has called
      `port.`{{SerialPort/readable}}`.`{{ReadableStream/getReader()}} or
      `port.`{{SerialPort/writable}}`.`{{WritableStream/getWriter()}} the stream
      is locked and the port cannot be closed. This forces the developer to
      decide how to handle any read or write operations that are in progress.

      For example, to ensure that all buffered data has been transmitted before
      the port is closed the application must await the {{Promise}} returned by
      `writer.`{{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/close()}}.

      <pre class="js">
        const encoder = new TextEncoder();
        const writer = port.writable.getWriter();
        writer.write(encoder.encode("A long message that will take..."));
        await writer.close();
        await port.close();
      </pre>

      To discard any unsent data the application could instead call
      `writer.`{{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/abort()}}.

      <p>
      If a {{TransformStream}} is being piped to `port`.{{SerialPort/writable}}
      then waiting for the {{Promise}} returned by
      `writer.`{{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/close()}} to resolve is
      insufficient. The application must wait for the pipe chain to close by
      waiting for the {{Promise}} returned by {{ReadableStream/pipeTo()}} to
      resolve instead.

      <pre class="js">
        const encoder = new TextEncoderStream();
        const writableStreamClosed = encoder.readable.pipeTo(port.writable);
        const writer = encoder.writable.getWriter();
        writer.write("A long message that will take...");
        writer.close();
        await writableStreamClosed;
        await port.close();
      </pre>

      If a loop is being used to read chunks from the port, as is done in
      [[[#readable-example]]], then it must be exited before calling
      `port.`{{SerialPort/close()}}.

      <pre class="js">
        let keepReading = true;
        let reader;

        async function readUntilClosed() {
          while (port.readable && keepReading) {
            reader = port.readable.getReader();
            try {
              while (true) {
                const { value, done } = await reader.read();
                if (done) {
                  // |reader| has been canceled.
                  break;
                }
                // Do something with |value|...
              }
            } catch (error) {
              // Handle |error|...
            } finally {
              reader.releaseLock();
            }
          }

          await port.close();
        }

        const closed = readUntilClosed();

        // Sometime later...
        keepReading = false;
        reader.cancel();
        await closed;
      </pre>

      Calling `reader.`{{ReadableStreamGenericReader/cancel()}} causes the call
      to `reader.`{{ReadableStreamDefaultReader/read()}} to return immediately,
      exiting the inner loop and calling
      `reader.`{{ReadableStreamDefaultReader/releaseLock()}}. The outer loop
      then exits because `keepReading` has been set to `false` and with the
      stream unlocked `port.`{{SerialPort/close()}} can complete successfully.

      <p>
      While it is also possible to call `port.`{{SerialPort/close()}}
      immediately after awaiting the {{Promise}} returned by
      `reader.`{{ReadableStreamGenericReader/cancel()}} it is better to place
      the call to `port.`{{SerialPort/close()}} as the last step of
      `readUntilClosed()` so that the port is also closed when a fatal error is
      encountered and `port.`{{SerialPort/readable}} becomes `null`.

  <h2>Security considerations</h2>

  This API poses similar a security risk to [[?WEB-BLUETOOTH]] and [[?WEBUSB]]
  and so lessons from those are applicable here. The primary threats are:

  <ul>
    <li>
    A malicious site that has tricked the user into granting it access to a
    device using the device's intended capabilities for malicious purposes. For
    example, a robot causing physical damage.

    <li>
    A malicious site that has tricked the user into granting it access to a
    device installing its own firmware into the device in order to modify the
    device's intended capabilities for malicious purposes or to attack the host
    to which it is connected. For example, triggering a buffer overflow in other
    host software which communicates with the device.

    <li>
    Malicious code injected into a trusted site which has been granted access to
    the device doing any of the above. For example, an online firmware update
    utility being hacked to deliver malicious firmware.

    <li>
    An attacker convincing the user to connect a malicious device to their
    system which colludes with a malicious or exploited site to create a
    web-based channel for communicating back to the attacker.
  </ul>

  The primary mitigation to all of these attacks is the {{Serial/requestPort()}}
  pattern, which requires user interaction and only supports granting access to
  a single device at a time. This prevents drive-by attacks because a site
  cannot enumerate all connected devices to determine whether a vulnerable
  device exists and must instead proactively inform the user that it desires
  access. Implementations may also provide a visual indication that a site is
  currently communicating with a device and controls for revoking that
  permission at any time.

  <p>
  This specification requires the site to be served from a [=secure context=] in
  order to prevent malicious code from being injected by a network-based
  attacker. This ensures that the site identity shown to the user when making
  permission decisions is accurate. This specification also requires top-level
  documents to opt-in through [[?PERMISSIONS-POLICY]] before allowing a
  cross-origin iframe to use the API. When combined with [[?CSP3]] these
  mechanisms provide protection against malicious code injection attacks.

  <p>
  The remaining concern is the exploitation of a connected device through a
  phishing attack that convinces the user to grant a malicious site access to a
  device. These attacks can be used to either exploit the device’s capabilities
  as designed or to install malicious firmware on the device that will in turn
  attack the host computer. Host software may be vulnerable to attack because it
  improperly validates input from connected devices. Security research in this
  area has encouraged software vendors to treat connected devices as
  untrustworthy.

  <p>
  There is no mechanism that will completely prevent this type of attack because
  data sent from a page to the device is an opaque sequence of bytes. Efforts to
  block a particular type of data from being sent are likely be met by
  workarounds on the part of device manufacturers who nevertheless want to send
  this type of data to their devices.

  <p>
  User agents can implement additional mechanisms to control access to devices:

  <ul>
    <li>
    A setting which prevents sites from calling {{Serial/requestPort()}} unless
    added to an explicit allow list.

    <p>
    Systems administrators could apply such a setting across their managed fleet
    using enterprise policy controls. Such controls may allow the administrator
    to automatically grant selected sites access to particular devices and no
    others.

    <li>
    A list of device IDs for hardware which is known to be exploitable could be
    deployed with the user agent. Connections to listed devices would be
    blocked. An implementation could use its automatic update or experiment
    management system to deploy updates to this list on the fly to block an
    active attack.
  </ul>

  Implementations of [[?WEB-BLUETOOTH]] and [[?WEBUSB]] have experimented with
  these mitigations however there are limits to their effectiveness. First, it
  is difficult to define whether a device is exploitable. For example, this API
  will allow a site to upload firmware to a microcontroller development board.
  This is a key use case for this API as these devices are common in the
  educational and hobbyist markets. These boards do not implement firmware
  signature verification and so can easily be turned into a malicious device.
  These boards are clearly exploitable but should not be blocked.

  <p>
  In addition, maintaining a list of vulnerable devices works well for USB and
  Bluetooth because those protocols define out-of-band mechanisms to gather
  device metadata. The make and model of such devices can thus be easily
  identified even if they present themselves to the host as a virtual serial
  ports. However, there are generic USB- or Bluetooth-to-serial adapters as well
  as systems with "real" serial ports using a DB-25, DE-9 or RJ-45 connector.
  For these there is no metadata that can be read to determine the identity of
  the device connected to the port and so blocking access to these is not
  possible.

  <h2>Privacy considerations</h2>

  Serial ports and serial devices contain two kinds of sensitive information.
  When a port is a USB or Bluetooth device there are identifiers such as the
  vendor and product IDs (which identify the make and model) as well as a serial
  number or MAC address. The serial device itself may also have its own
  identifier that is available through commands sent via the serial port. The
  device may also store other private information which may or may not be
  identifying.

  <p>
  In order to manage device permissions an implementation will likely store
  device identifiers such as the USB vendor ID, product ID and serial number in
  its user preferences file to be used as stable identifiers for devices the
  user has granted sites access to. These would not be shared directly with
  sites and would be cleared when permission is revoked or site data in general
  is cleared.

  <p>
  Commands a page can send to the device after it has been granted access a page
  may also be able to access any of the other sensitive information stored by
  the device. For the reasons mentioned in [[[#security]]] it is impractical and
  undesirable to attempt to prevent a page from accessing this information.

  <p>
  Implementations should provide users with complete control over which devices
  a site can access and not grant device access without user interaction. This
  is the intention of the {{Serial/requestPort()}} method. This prevents a site
  from silently enumerating and collecting data from all connected devices. This
  is similar to the file picker UI. A site has no knowledge of the filesystem,
  only the files or directories that have been chosen by the user. An
  implementation could notify the user when a site is using these permissions
  with an indicator icon appearing in the tab or address bar.

  <p>
  Implementations that provide a "private" or "incognito" browsing mode should
  ensure that permissions from the user's normal profile do not carry over to
  such a session and permissions granted in this session are not persisted when
  the session ends. An implementation may warn the user when granting access to
  a device in such as session as, similar to entering identifying information by
  hand, device identifiers and other unique properties available from
  communicating with the device mentioned previously can be used to identify the
  user between sessions.

  <p>
  Users may be surprised by the capabilities granted by this API if they do not
  understand the ways in which granting access to a device breaks traditional
  isolation boundaries in the web security model. Security UI and documentation
  should explain that granting a site access to a device could give the site
  full control over the device and any data contained within.
