The <cite>Serial API</cite> provides a way for websites to read and write from
a serial device through script. Such an API would bridge the web and the
physical world, by allowing documents to communicate with devices such as
microcontrollers, 3D printers, and other serial devices.
  
There is also a companion <a

## Usage example

This example shows how to request an Arduino device from the user and set it up
for use.

<pre class="example js" title="Requesting an Arduino device">
  const requestOptions = {
    // Filter on devices with the Arduino USB vendor ID.
    filters: [{ vendorId: 0x2341 }],
  };

  // Request an Arduino from the user.
  const port = await navigator.serial.requestPort(requestOptions);

  // Open and begin reading.
  await port.open({ baudrate: 115200 });
  const reader = port.in.getReader();

  for await (const { done, data } of reader.read()) {
    if (done) break;
    console.log(data);
  }
</pre>

  The {{Serial/requestPort()}} method requests access to a serial port of the user's
  choice (see [[[#security]]]).

  When the {{Serial/requestPort()}} method is invoked, the user agent MUST perform the
  following steps:

  1. Let |promise:Promise| be [=a new promise=].
  1. Return |promise| and run the remaining steps asynchronously.
  1. Request access to a serial port (see [[[#security]]]):
    1. If the access request is rejected, [=reject=] |promise| with an
        {{"AbortError"}} {{DOMException}}.
    1. Otherwise, let |port:SerialPort| be the {{SerialPort}} for which access
        was granted.
    1. [=Resolve=] |promise| with |port|.

  ### Serial port metadata

  The value of certain attributes is dependent on the method that the system used
  to establish the serial port (e.g., USB), and so might not always be available.

  ### Recommended serial port metadata

  When available, it is RECOMMENDED that user agents populate a {{SerialPortInfo}}
  object with the following information. If the value of piece of metadata is
  unavailable(e.g., if the manufacturer is unknown), then it is RECOMMENDED that
  that metadata be excluded from the {{SerialPortInfo}}. For interoperability,
  user agents SHOULD use the values provided in they "Key" column of the
  <a>table of recommended metadata</a>.

  ### Getting serial port metadata

  The <dfn>steps for getting metadata of a serial port</dfn> for a |serial
  port| are as follows. The steps always return an instance of
  {{SerialPortInfo}}, which contains the related metadata.

  1. Let |info:SerialPortInfo| be a newly created {{SerialPortInfo}} object.
  1. Let |path:DOMString| be a {{DOMString}} that represents the path of the |serial port|.
  1. Invoke |info|'s `set()` method using the string `"path"` as the
     key, and |path| as the value.
  1. For each additional metadata item known about the |serial port|,
      perform the following sub-steps. Please see the <a>table of recommended
      metadata</a> for a list of recommended metadata items that SHOULD be
      included.
      1. Let |key:DOMString| be a {{DOMString}} for the commonly used name for this
        key.
      1. Let |value:DOMString| be a {{DOMString}} for the commonly used name for
        this key, or `null` otherwise.
      1. Invoke |info|'s `set()` method using the string "path" as the
        key, and |path| as the value.
  1. Return |info|.

  ## Security considerations

  This section defines the <dfn>Security considerations</dfn> for the <cite>
  Serial API</cite>.

  It is RECOMMENDED that an user interface be presented to the user to allow them
  to select the serial ports that the page can access. Such an interface would
  allow an end user to select zero ore more serial ports on the device - or to
  reject the request to access any ports.

  A user agent SHOULD allow the user to select from all serial ports available
  on the machine, and be shown an indicator for serial ports that are currently
  busy, either as a result of prior calls to `requestPorts()` or are in
  use by the system.

  It is also RECOMMENDED that user agents provide users with a means for the end-
  user to view which independently of any access request, and be given the
  ability to revoke individual or complete access to serial ports at any time
  either at the user agent level or per [=origin=].
</section>

<section class="informative">
  ## Use cases and requirements

  ### Hardware disconnection
  Some devices allow users to manually reset the connection between the user
  agent and the physical device (e.g., by pushing a button). One example
  device is the Arduino. Another example is the user abruptly disconnecting
  one device from another, thus severing the communication channel.

  As such, it is a requirement that the API gracefully handle abrupt
  disconnection caused by a reset or other event. When such disconnections
  occur, the API must make it possible for the developer to be notified of such
  disconnections. When possible, the API should provide details about the
  disconnection (e.g., reason, time, etc.).

  ### Baud rates
  Traditionally, serial devices have operated at
  [baud rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud)
  of between 50 and 115,200 bps.

  However, modern USB serial devices are able to operate at significantly higher
  baud rates than legacy hardware. For example, the
  [bioloid servos](http://support.robotis.com/en/techsupport_eng.htm#product/dynamixel/ax_series/dxl_ax_actuator.htm)
  operate at 1 Mbit (1,000,000 bps). Other USB-to-serial chips are able to
  operate at 3 MBit (3,000,000bps).

  Additionally, other serial devices have standardized baud rates that
  are not in the commonly accepted value for baud rates. For example,
  [MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) uses a baud rate of 31,250 bps,
  while a [DMX512 controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512)
  transmits data at 250kbps.

  As such, it is a requirement that the Serial API does not limit the
  baud rates to a traditional range. Instead, the API must allow a
  developer to specify any rate so long as the value is an unsigned number.
  If there is a baud rate that is common for a large range of hardware that
  will make use of this API, the API should provide a default baud rate value.

  Given the above requirement, it is possible to create software to wrap the
  Serial API to restrict the possible baud rates used for communicating with some
  particular hardware. For example, a JavaScript library that communicates with
  a MIDI device could automatically set the baud rate to 31,250 bps without
  needing to bother the developer to specify the value.
