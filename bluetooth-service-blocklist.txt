# This file holds a list of Bluetooth custom service UUIDs that websites using
# the Web Serial API are forbidden from accessing.
#
# The format of each line is a 128-bit service class UUID rendered as a
# hexadecimal string with the format `01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef`.
#
# Example:
#   01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
#
# Generic serial adapters should not be added to this list because they do not
# provide any metadata about the connected serial device.
#
# All service class UUIDs that use the Bluetooth SIG Base UUID (that is, all
# UUIDs that end in `-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`) are blocked by default
# except the Serial Port Profile UUID (`00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`).
# Service class UUIDs that use the base UUID should not be added to this list.
#
# Additions to this file must be made by pull request. Please keep entries
# sorted.
